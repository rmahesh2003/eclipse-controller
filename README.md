# `gphoto2`-based Eclipse Automation

A few quick notes:
* Script has  been field-tested
* It is not advisable to look at the partial phase, diamond ring, Baily's Beads, or [anything other than totality](https://www.covingtoninnovations.com/michael/blog/1708/170819-AAS-Chou-Solar-Eclipse-Eye-Safety.pdf) without a filter.
* The script requires `gphoto2` and `festival` speech-synthesis engine invokable on the command-line
* Tweak the exposures and timings as you deem fit


## Dependencies
* System dependencies: `gphoto2`, `festival`, `Python >= 3.10`
* Python dependencies: `tqdm`
